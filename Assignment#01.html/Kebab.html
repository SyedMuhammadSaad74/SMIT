    <p>In Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh (Arabic: كتاب الطبيخ), a compendium of
        much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisine, there are descriptions of kabāb as cut-up meat,
        either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire.

        However, while the word kebab or shish kebab may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to
        any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer,kebab is mainly associated with a diversity of meat
        dishes that originated in the medieval kitchens of Persia and Anatolia.Though the word has ancient origins,
        it was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to this range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked
        on skewers, but also as stews, meatballs, and other forms.This cuisine has spread around the world, in
        parallel with Muslim influence.According to Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller, kebab was served in the royal
        houses during the Delhi Sultanate , and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan.[7]
        Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous
        doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.[3]

        The word kebab likely came to English in the late 17th century from the Arabic kabāb, partly through Hindustani,
        Persian and Turkish.According to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word kebap is also derived from the
        Arabic word kabāb, meaning roasted meat. It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in Kyssa-i
        Yusuf (lit'the story of Joseph'), though still in the Arabic form. Nişanyan states that the word has the
        equivalent meaning of 'frying, burning' with kabābu in the old Akkadian language, and kbabā כבבא in Aramaic.[9]
        In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the
        Persian kabab, which probably derived from the Aramaic.

        The American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of 'burn',
        'char', or 'roast', from the Aramaic and Akkadian.The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not
        be kabbaba (burned).These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: *kab-, to
        burn or roast.</p>
