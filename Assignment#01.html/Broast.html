    <p>The Broasting technique was introduced in 1954 when American businessman and inventor, L.A.M. Phelan, combined
        parts of a deep fryer and pressure cooker as a way to cook chicken more quickly. With his invention, Phelan
        trademarked the words "broaster" and "broasted food".Phelan manufactured the first Broaster Pressure
        Fryers under Flavor Fast Foods, Inc. and in 1956 formed the Broaster Company, expanding its line of offerings to
        include food product ingredients and accessories.

        In 1970, the Alco Standard Corporation[9] of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania purchased the Broaster Company. In 1991,
        Alco sold the Broaster Company to a group of private investors.

        In 2009, Jay Cipra was named CEO of Broaster Company LLC, after serving as president of its parent company
        Broaster Company, Inc.Broaster Company celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2014.</p>
