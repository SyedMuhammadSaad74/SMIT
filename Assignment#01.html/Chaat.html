    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chaat</h1>
    <p>Some of the dishes now categorized as chaats, such as Dahi Vada, can be traced back to ancient periods. A recipe
        for a dahi vada analogue called kshiravata is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia
        compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.According to food historian K.T Achaya,
        descriptions of dahi vada also appear in literature far earlier from 500 BC.

        Another dish resembling as chaat as an organized phenomenon or distinct group of dishes, according to culinary
        anthropologist Kurush Dalal, originated in northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) in the late 17th century during
        the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The royal doctors had asked the people of Delhi to consume spicy and
        fried snacks, as well as dahi, as a countermeasure to the alkaline water of the Yamuna river that coursed
        through the city.

        Most chaats originated in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in India later in 20th century,but they are now eaten
        all across South Asia and neighboring countries. Some are results of cultural syncretism.</p>
