    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Dessert</h1>
    <p>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as candy, and possibly a
        beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world, such as Greece and West Africa, and most
        parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.

        The term dessert can apply to many sweets, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams,
        pastries, pies, puddings, macaroons, sweet soups, tarts, and fruit salad. Fruit is also commonly found in
        dessert courses, because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more
        commonly savory to create desserts.</p>
