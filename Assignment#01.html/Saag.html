    <p>Saag (Hindustani), also spelled sag or saga, is a Indian subcontinental leafy vegetable dish eaten with
        bread such as roti or naan,or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from spinach, mustard greens,
        collard greens, basella, finely chopped broccoli or other greens, along with added spices and sometimes other
        ingredients such as chhena.

        In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province. In India, it is common especially in the state of
        Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered
        to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where
        the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a
        yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the
        North Indian state of Haryana.</p>
