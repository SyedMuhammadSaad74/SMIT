  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Haleem</h1>
  <p>Haleem is a type of stew that is widely consumed in South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia. Although the dish
    varies from region to region, it optionally includes wheat or barley, meat and lentils. It is made by blending or
    mashing the meat in the curry and serving hot with flat breads or on its own. The original Haleem, which is
    different from this variety, is an ancient Iranian dish served with wheat, meat, cinnamon, and sugar that remains
    popular in Iran to this day. Popular variations of haleem include ke≈ükek in Turkey, Afghanistan, Tajikistan,
    Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; harisa in the Arab world and Armenia; halim in Iran, West Bengal, in
    Mauritius and Bangladesh; and khichra in Pakistan and India</p>
