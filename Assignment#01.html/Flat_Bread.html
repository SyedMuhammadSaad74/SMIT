    <p>A flatbread is a bread made with flour; water, milk, yogurt, or other liquid; and salt, and then thoroughly
        rolled into flattened dough. Many flatbreads are unleavened, although some are leavened, such as pizza and pita
        bread.

        Flatbreads range from below one millimeter to a few centimeters thick so that they can be easily eaten without
        being sliced. They can be baked in an oven, fried in hot oil, grilled over hot coals, cooked on a hot pan, tava,
        comal, or metal griddle, and eaten fresh or packaged and frozen for later use.</p>
