    <p>Chicken karahi (known as gosht karahi when prepared with goat or lamb meat instead of chicken), or kadai chicken,
        is a chicken dish from Pakistan.

        It is noted for its spicy taste and is notable in Pakistani cuisine. The dish is prepared in a karahi (a type of
        wok) and can take between 30 and 50 minutes to prepare and cook the dish. Cumin, green chilis, ginger,
        garlic, tomatoes and coriander are key to the flavor of the dish.[4] It is usually served with naan, roti or
        rice. This dish is one of the hallmarks of Pakistani cuisine.</p>
