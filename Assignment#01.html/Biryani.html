    <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are
        steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender
        texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll
        find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics
        it's marinated in.

        Whether you're talking Arroz con Pollo, Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Oyako Donburi, chicken and rice is a classic
        pairing that has permeated culinary culture around the world. It makes sense that earlier in human history, this
        staple grain would be combined with a domesticated source of protein. Still, the fact that this combination has
        endured as a popular favorite today, speaks to its unassailable deliciousness.For my Chicken Biryani recipe,
        I've simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic,
        ginger, chili peppers, coriander leaves, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the
        chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to make the fried onions separately, as it allows
        you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the
        rice, a quick par-boil with whole spices like cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while
        ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.</p>
